## About Me ##
* I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Economics](https://economics.wustl.edu/) at Washington University in St. Louis, under the supervision of Prof. [Philip H. Dybvig](https://dybfin.wustl.edu/). I expect to graduate in May 2022.
* My research interests lie in Law and Economics, Corporate Finance, Banking and Economic Theory. My current works focus on corporate bankruptcy and liability.


### _Gambling for Redemption or Ripoff, and the Impact of Superpriority_
(_joint with Philip Dybvig_)

Myers (1977) described how firms can gamble using asset substitution, which is switching to a less efficient and more volatile project. Gambling using derivatives is a sharper instrument, allowing the firm to gamble just to what is needed, and with negligible efficiency loss. We study gambling using derivatives, made more available by recent changes in the bankruptcy law granting repos and other derivatives "superpriority," which is exemption from the automatic stay and clawback in bankruptcy. In our model, "gambling for redemption" operates at small scale and is socially beneficial, while "gambling for ripoff" operates at large scale and is socially inefficient but benefits stockholders at the expense of bondholders. Superpriority laws reduce firm value by making it harder for firms to borrow due to anticipation of gambling for ripoff.

###  _Limited Liability and Scale (JMP)_

Does limited liability on damages improve efficiency?  This paper provides a theoretical model considering firm’s preference for care and scale when the outside stakeholders (consumers, employees, suppliers, communities, governments, etc.) obtain benefits from the firm. The results show that the optimal liability rule trades off damages to the tort claimants against benefits to the outside stakeholders. Full liability provides efficient care but scale is too small because it internalizes all the damages without internalizing all the benefits.  Limited liability has less than efficient care but larger scale than full liability and tends to be more efficient if outside stakeholders havea larger potential value. If this potential value falls (for example, with more competition), the equilibrium with full liability converges to the first best. But it deviates from the first best with limited liability, encouraging low care level and large scale.  Therefore, limited liability is not a one-size-fits-all policy to achieve the optimum for different firms. This opens up possibilities ofother rules to adjust for cross-firm differences.

### _Direct Transfer and Guanxi in Resolving Contract Failure_

Guanxi (relationship-building in China) has a mixed reputation. It can be used to implement corruption, e.g. to get a job for an underqualified relative, but it can also be used to facilitate beneficial trade. In this paper I compare guanxi to direct transfers. Both facilitate transactions, good and bad. The results show that if most projects are bad, it could be good to ban both guanxi and transfers. Otherwise, guanxi alone can be more helpful in facilitating beneficial transaction than a direct transfer alone, but having both channels can be even better for useful self-selection and therefore blocking transfers can be bad. Specifically, blocking transfer causes a decreased reliance on guanxi if the official's motive is aligned with the rest of the world, but it causes an increased reliance on guanxi if the official's motive is not so aligned.
