## About Me ##
* I am a Postdoc Research Associate at Cambridge Endowment for Research in Finance (CERF), Cambridge Judge Business School. [My page there.](https://www.cerf.cam.ac.uk/people/cerf-postdocs/currentpostdocs/xinyu-hou)
* I completed my BA (Economics) and BS (Mathematics) at Wuhan University, and PhD in Economics at Washington University in St. Louis, where my PhD supervisor was Nobel Prize laureate [Philip H. Dybvig](https://dybfin.wustl.edu/). I am currently working on a paper with Prof. Dybvig about firm gambling using derivatives under the impact of "superpriority," which are bankruptcy safe harbor protections for qualified financial contracts (QFCs). See below.
* My research interests lie in general Law and Economics, Corporate Finance, Banking and Economic Theory. My current works focus on corporate bankruptcy and liability.
* I am also a Research Associate at Cambridge Centre for Finance (CCFin), and I am affiliated with Cambridge Trinity College.
* I am a gym rat. I also like sketching, playing the YangQin (a Chinese musical instrument), praciticing Aikido, and 无为(wúwéi).

### _Gambling for Redemption or Ripoff, and the Impact of Superpriority_ 
(_joint with Philip Dybvig_)

Asset substitution is gambling by firms switching to less efficient and more volatile projects. Gambling using derivatives is a sharper instrument, allowing owners to gamble just to what is needed, with negligible efficiency loss. In our results, “gambling for redemption” operates at small scale and is socially beneficial, while “gambling for ripoff” operates at large scale and is socially inefficient but benefits firm owners at the expense of bondholders. Gambling at scale is available in countries with weak legal systems, and in the U.S. for Qualified Financial Contracts (QFCs) granted exemption to bankruptcy provisions by superpriority laws. Availability of gambling at scale reduces firm value due to difficulty borrowing given potential gambling for ripoff.

###  _Limited Liability: Playing It Safe or Going Big? (JMP)_

Does limited liability on damages improve social efficiency? I show that optimal liability rules trades off tort damages against benefits to outside stakeholders. Full liability promotes care but raises marginal costs, inducing less-than-efficient scale. Limited liability enhances scale but reduces care, proving more efficient than full liability when outside stakeholder value is high. As market competition grows, liability’s impact on scale diminishes, and internalizing more damages would increase efficiency. We conclude that limited liability is not one-size-fits-all; tailored policies like requiring insurance for contractors and nuclear decommissioning trusts (NDTs) can help adjust for cross-firm differences.

### _Direct Transfer and Guanxi in Resolving Contract Failure_

Guanxi (relationship-building in China) has a mixed reputation. It can be used to implement corruption, e.g. to get a job for an underqualified relative, but it can also be used to facilitate beneficial trade. In this paper I compare guanxi to direct transfers. Both facilitate transactions, good and bad. The results show that if most projects are bad, it could be good to ban both guanxi and transfers. Otherwise, guanxi alone can be more helpful in facilitating beneficial transaction than a direct transfer alone, but having both channels can be even better for useful self-selection and therefore blocking transfers can be bad. Specifically, blocking transfer causes a decreased reliance on guanxi if the official's motive is aligned with the rest of the world, but it causes an increased reliance on guanxi if the official's motive is not so aligned.

###  _Work in progress: How Deep is Your Pocket?_

In numerous tort litigations, particularly when multiple defendants are implicated, a plaintiff may target a defendant known for their "deep pockets." This choice is influenced not solely by the defendant's actual responsibility or culpability but also by their significant financial capacity to handle hefty judgments or settlements. This raises an intriguing question: How does the financial depth of these "deep pockets" influence an investor's decision to invest in high-risk ventures? I find that if the downside is toxic, in one equilibrium nobody with
