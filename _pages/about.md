## About Me ##
* I am a Postdoc Research Associate at Cambridge Endowment for Research in Finance (CERF), Cambridge Judge Business School. [My page there.](https://www.cerf.cam.ac.uk/people/cerf-postdocs/currentpostdocs/xinyu-hou)
* I completed my BA (Economics) and BS (Mathematics) at Wuhan University, and PhD in Economics at Washington University in St. Louis, where my PhD supervisor was Nobel Prize laureate [Philip H. Dybvig](https://dybfin.wustl.edu/). I am currently working on a paper with Prof. Dybvig about firm gambling using derivatives under the impact of "superpriority," which are bankruptcy safe harbor protections for qualified financial contracts (QFCs). See below.
* My research interests lie in general Law and Economics, Corporate Finance, Banking and Economic Theory. My current works focus on corporate bankruptcy and liability.
* I am also a Research Associate at Cambridge Centre for Finance (CCFin), and I am affiliated with Cambridge Trinity College.
* I am a gym rat. I also like sketching, playing Yang Qin (a Chinese musical instrument), and doing nothing.

### _Gambling for Redemption or Ripoff, and the Impact of Superpriority_ 
(_joint with Philip Dybvig_)

Asset substitution is gambling by firms switching to less efficient and more volatile projects. Gambling using derivatives is a sharper instrument, allowing owners to gamble just to what is needed, with negligible efficiency loss. In our results, “gambling for redemption” operates at small scale and is socially beneficial, while “gambling for ripoff” operates at large scale and is socially inefficient but benefits firm owners at the expense of bondholders. Gambling at scale is available in countries with weak legal systems, and in the U.S. for Qualified Financial Contracts (QFCs) granted exemption to bankruptcy provisions by superpriority laws. Availability of gambling at scale reduces firm value due to difficulty borrowing given potential gambling for ripoff.

###  _Limited Liability and Investment (JMP)_

Does limited liability on damages improve efficiency?  This paper provides a theoretical model considering firm’s preference for care and scale when the outside stakeholders (consumers, employees, suppliers, communities, governments, etc.) obtain benefits from the firm. The results show that the optimal liability rule trades off damages to the tort claimants against benefits to the outside stakeholders. Full liability provides efficient care but scale is too small because it internalizes all the damages without internalizing all the benefits.  Limited liability has less than efficient care but larger scale than full liability and tends to be more efficient if outside stakeholders havea larger potential value. If this potential value falls (for example, with more competition), the equilibrium with full liability converges to the first best. But it deviates from the first best with limited liability, encouraging low care level and large scale.  Therefore, limited liability is not a one-size-fits-all policy to achieve the optimum for different firms. This opens up possibilities ofother rules to adjust for cross-firm differences.

### _Direct Transfer and Guanxi in Resolving Contract Failure_

Guanxi (relationship-building in China) has a mixed reputation. It can be used to implement corruption, e.g. to get a job for an underqualified relative, but it can also be used to facilitate beneficial trade. In this paper I compare guanxi to direct transfers. Both facilitate transactions, good and bad. The results show that if most projects are bad, it could be good to ban both guanxi and transfers. Otherwise, guanxi alone can be more helpful in facilitating beneficial transaction than a direct transfer alone, but having both channels can be even better for useful self-selection and therefore blocking transfers can be bad. Specifically, blocking transfer causes a decreased reliance on guanxi if the official's motive is aligned with the rest of the world, but it causes an increased reliance on guanxi if the official's motive is not so aligned.

###  _Working in progress: How Deep is Your Pocket?_

In numerous corporate tort litigations, particularly when multiple defendants are implicated, a plaintiff may target a defendant known for their "deep pockets." This choice is influenced not solely by the defendant's actual responsibility or culpability but also by their significant financial capacity to handle hefty judgments or settlements. This raises an intriguing question: How does the financial depth of these "deep pockets" influence an investor's decision to invest in high-risk ventures?
