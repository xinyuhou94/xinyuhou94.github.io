## About Me ##
* I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Economics](https://economics.wustl.edu/) at Washington University in St. Louis, advised by Prof. [Philip H. Dybvig](https://dybfin.wustl.edu/).
* My research interests lie in law and economics, corporate finance, banking and economic theory.


### _Gambling for Redemption or Ripoff, and the Impact of Superpriority_
(_joint with Philip Dybvig_)

New U.S. bankruptcy laws exempt repos and derivatives from the automatic stay and clawbacks, giving them “superpriority” over claims resolved in bankruptcy. Motivated by the new laws, we study gambling by firms. We find that gambling can be understood from two polar cases. _“Gambling for redemption”_ preserves firms’ continuation value more often without hurting bondholders, while _“gambling for ripoff”_ destroys firms’ continuation value most of the time, benefiting owners at the expense of bondholders. If anticipated, the ability to gamble at large scale (possibly due to superpriority) impairs borrowing capacity and reduces the equity value of the firm.

###  _Tort Liability and Investment (JMP)_

This paper builds a theoretical framework to study investors' choices of safety and productivity under different liability rules when market forces do not work well to internalize damages. We find that limited liability can be socially damaging when tort is large and demand is elastic, because firms who fail to internalize damage likely under-invest in safety and over-invest in quantity. While a firm with strict liability and deep-pocket investors has correct incentives for safety, excessive liability may halt a valuable project which can otherwise be conducted with positive social value under limited liability. With potentially judgment-proof investors, however, strict liability distorts incentives and the firm's choices can deviate further from the first-best compared to limited liability. 

### _Direct Transfer and Guanxi in Resolving Contract Failure_

Guanxi (relationship-building in China) has a mixed reputation. It can be used to implement corruption, e.g. to get a job for an underqualified relative, but it can also be used to facilitate beneficial trade. In this paper I compare guanxi to direct transfers. Both facilitate transactions, good and bad. The results show that if most projects are bad, it could be good to ban both guanxi and transfers. Otherwise, guanxi alone can be more helpful in facilitating beneficial transaction than a direct transfer alone, but having both channels can be even better for useful self-selection and therefore blocking transfers can be bad. Specifically, blocking transfer causes a decreased reliance on guanxi if the official's motive is aligned with the rest of the world, but it causes an increased reliance on guanxi if the official's motive is not so aligned.
