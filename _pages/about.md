## About Me ##
* I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Economics](https://economics.wustl.edu/) at Washington University in St. Louis, under the supervision of Prof. [Philip H. Dybvig](https://dybfin.wustl.edu/). I expect to graduate in May 2022.
* My research interests lie in Law and Economics, Corporate Finance, Banking and Economic Theory. My research on Law and Economics focuses on bankruptcy, corporate and tort.


### _Gambling for Redemption or Ripoff, and the Impact of Superpriority_
(_joint with Philip Dybvig_)

New U.S. bankruptcy laws exempt repos and derivatives from the automatic stay and clawbacks, giving them “superpriority” over claims resolved in bankruptcy. Motivated by the new laws, we study gambling by firms. We find that gambling can be understood from two polar cases. _“Gambling for redemption”_ preserves firms’ continuation value more often without hurting bondholders, while _“gambling for ripoff”_ destroys firms’ continuation value most of the time, benefiting owners at the expense of bondholders. If anticipated, the ability to gamble at large scale (possibly due to superpriority) impairs borrowing capacity and reduces the equity value of the firm.

###  _Tort Liability and Investment (JMP)_

Why limited liability? This paper builds a theoretical framework to study investors' choices of safety and quantity under different liability rules when contracts cannot be made to internalize damages. We find that when the firm's other stakeholders (investors, consumers, employees, suppliers, communities, government, etc.) have a substantial share of benefits in the firm, bearing full liability is socially inefficient because it undermines the incentives to invest in quantity and even halts beneficial projects especially when there is fixed cost. Limiting liability externalizes some damages, enhancing social welfare by mitigating the externalization of benefits. With more competition, the equilibrium of full liability converges to the first best, while the equilibria of limited liability (either limited by the limited liability rule or by investors being judgment-proof) deviate from the first best and encourage underinvestment in safety and overinvestment in quantity. Requiring capital installment internalizes some of the damages under the limited liability rule and can give correct incentives when there is enough competition. Yet if deep-pocket investors bear full liability, requiring capital contributes to low quantity and social inefficiency.

### _Direct Transfer and Guanxi in Resolving Contract Failure_

Guanxi (relationship-building in China) has a mixed reputation. It can be used to implement corruption, e.g. to get a job for an underqualified relative, but it can also be used to facilitate beneficial trade. In this paper I compare guanxi to direct transfers. Both facilitate transactions, good and bad. The results show that if most projects are bad, it could be good to ban both guanxi and transfers. Otherwise, guanxi alone can be more helpful in facilitating beneficial transaction than a direct transfer alone, but having both channels can be even better for useful self-selection and therefore blocking transfers can be bad. Specifically, blocking transfer causes a decreased reliance on guanxi if the official's motive is aligned with the rest of the world, but it causes an increased reliance on guanxi if the official's motive is not so aligned.
